# Scrum Poker during Corona Lockdown

*Published: June 4, 2020*

Check out our online scrum poker tool.

While we didn't have a complete lockdown in Switzerland, most development teams worked from home during the last 3 months and will probably be in their home offices for a few more weeks.

During that time many teams needed to estimate stories for their Scrum process. After some tries with chat messages, we quickly started using a tool that we once developed on a VIUday to get to know the VUE javascript framework together with firebase for data storage.

The tool is far from perfect and the UX was not really considered at all - but it works - and if you have the same need and want to try it, feel free to do so on [scrum.viu.ch](https://scrum.viu.ch/)
